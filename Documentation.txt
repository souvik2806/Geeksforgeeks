Explanation:
1.Taken number of rows in each half of the diamond in variable n
2.Decrementing row number by 1 and assigned the value to c
3.Use loop starting from 1 to (2*k-1) to print '*'
4.Half of the diamond is printed
5.For the next half,c is assigned value 1
6.Used another loop starting from 1 to(2*(n-k)-1) to print '*'
